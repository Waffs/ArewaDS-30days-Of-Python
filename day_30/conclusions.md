# Conclusions
In the process of going through this material I have learned quite a lot and i have been inspired to do more. Having gone through these rigorous 30 days of python exercises and projects, i have been equipped with the base knowledge to go into a data analysis, data science, machine learning or web development path. 

Special appreciation goes to Mr Asabeneh S. Yetayeh for creating this amazing learning content.

I also extend my appreciation to the mentors of `Arewa Data Science Academy Machine Learning Fellowship` for guiding us throughout the duration of the Python phase of the fellowship.
